[Basic function test]
1. prepare a file contains 10 lines and 10 number in each line, ensure the output is right
2. check output of usage
3. check whether both positive and negative numbers can be handled in one file
4. using unittest frame, call functions defined in target scripts directly
5. for the input file, both absolute path and relative path should be supported

[Negative test]
1. incorrect number of parameters, expected parameter is only one
2. input parameter is not a file

[Robustness]
1. run this script when target file is empty
2. run this script when target file has special characters (such characters will be skipped in current design)
3. run this script if there are empty lines and/or rows in input file
4. run this script when target file contains strings but not number

[scalability test]
1. check how many lines the script plan to support(it's 5000 defined in script right now)
2. check how many numbers in each line the script can support (it's 2000 defined in current script)
3. check whether the script works well if all numbers in input file are maximum of float. no overflow exception

[performance]
1. check performance of scripts when it contains 5000 lines and 2000 numbers in each line(current maximum limitation)

[Platform compatibility test]
1. run the script on Linux and Windows platform, both should work
